Last year, for my Machine Learning class final, I wrote a machine learning library called [AML (Arvin's ML Library)](https://github.com/ArvinSKuswaha/AML). Though I'm still a bit salty about my grade :eyes:, I've decided to expand on that project, resulting in this, Arvin's ML Library 2. Once this project reaches a point where it is suitable for distribution, I will officially release it. And as an Open Source project, contributions are welcome! Just raise an issue, let me know what you want to contribute, and submit a pull request.
